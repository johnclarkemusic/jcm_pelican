<article>This song uses one of the first chord progressions I learned on guitar: A-minor, D-minor, and E7.  As young guitar student, I loved just jamming with these chords, arpeggios and the scale tones in between.  Eventually my jams evolved into this song.  Since it was one of the first chord progressions and musical ideas of my guitar life that grew and changed until I had committed it to paper, I named it "The Most Evolved" out of a collection of songs I had written.
